If you have environment variables set up for paths, you may want to add them as favourites to the file browser favorites. 
This is possible with a tcl command for example my environment variable `%AN_PROJECT`

```
[getenv AN_PROJECT]
```


The prefernce file can be directly edited eg.
```
c:\Users\sreeves\.nuke\FileChooser_Favorites.pref
```
